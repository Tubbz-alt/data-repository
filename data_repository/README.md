# ETL procedure for bird profile data

## Which data to select from BALTRAD FTP

1. Go to `/data`. This directory does not have subdirectories and contains raw polar volume data (`_pvol_`) and bird profile data (`_vp_`).
2. Select the bird profile data by only selecting files with `_vp_` in the name.
